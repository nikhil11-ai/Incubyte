## SQL Queries

All the SQL queries used to derive these insights are stored in the file `queries.sql`. These queries were executed on the MySQL database using the `assignment` schema, where the dataset was loaded into the `assessment_dataset` table.

## How to Use

1. **Load the Dataset**: 
   - Import the dataset into your MySQL database.
   - Create the table using the provided schema and load the CSV data into the table.

2. **Run SQL Queries**: 
   - Run the SQL queries from the `queries.sql` file to generate the desired insights.
   
3. **Analyze Results**: 
   - Review the output from each query to understand trends and behaviors in the data.

## Conclusion
